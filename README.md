# Implementing-Core-Automata-DFA-CFG-and-PDA
## Overview

This project provides a Python-based framework for simulating various types of automata using configuration files. The system is designed to support four types of automata commonly used in computational theory:

- Deterministic Finite Automata (**DFA**)
- Pushdown Automata (**PDA**)
- Context-Free Grammar (**CFG**)

<br>

Each automaton type is configurable via text-based configuration files and can be executed or emulated using this framework. The configuration files follow specific formats and structure, which are parsed and validated to ensure proper automaton behavior.

## Key Features

- **Automaton Simulation**: The system supports both deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata (DFA/NFA), pushdown automata (PDA), and context-free grammar (CFG) parsing.
- **Configuration-based**: Automata are defined using structured configuration files, allowing users to easily describe the components and rules of each automaton.
- **Error Handling**: The framework validates each automaton's configuration and provides meaningful error messages to guide users in correcting invalid inputs.
- **Modular Design**: The code is organized into reusable modules for parsing configuration files, simulating automata, and managing user interactions.
